    "- \\( y \\) is the original data.\n",
    "- \\( y($\\lambda$) \\) is the transformed data.\n",
    "- \\( $\\lambda$ \\) is the transformation parameter.\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Parameter \\($\\lambda$\\)**:\n",
    "- The parameter \\($\\lambda$\\) is estimated from the data and can take on any real value.\n",
    "- Common values of \\($\\lambda$\\) include:\n",
    "- \\( $\\lambda$ = 1 \\): No transformation (original data).\n",
    "- \\( $\\lambda$ = 0.5 \\): Square root transformation.\n",
    "- \\( $\\lambda$ = 0 \\): Natural logarithm transformation.\n",
    "- \\( $\\lambda$ = -1 \\): Reciprocal transformation.\n",
    "2. **Purpose**:\n",
    "- To make the data more normal-like.\n",
    "- To stabilize the variance across the dataset, particularly useful in linear regression where homoscedasticity is assumed.\n",
    "3. **Application**:\n",
    "- The transformation is applied to each data point in the dataset.\n",
    "- After the transformation, statistical techniques that assume normality and homoscedasticity can be more appropriately applied.\n",
    "4. **Choosing \\($\\lambda$\\)**:\n",
    "- The value of \\($\\lambda$\\) that best normalizes the data and stabilizes variance is typically found using maximum likelihood estimation.\n",
    "- Statistical software can be used to determine the optimal \\($\\lambda$\\) value.\n",
    "### Example of Usage:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset where the response variable \\( y \\) has a skewed distribution and the variance of \\( y \\) changes with the level of an independent variable. Applying a Box-Cox transformation might help to:\n",
    "- Transform the skewed distribution into one that is more symmetric (i.e., closer to normal).\n",
    "- Stabilize the variance, making the variability of \\( y \\) more consistent across different levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Estimate \\($\\lambda$\\)**: Using maximum likelihood estimation or another method to find the value of \\($\\lambda$\\) that makes the data approximately normal and stabilizes variance.\n",
    "2. **Transform Data**: Apply the Box-Cox transformation to the data using the estimated \\($\\lambda$\\).\n",
    "3. **Analyze Transformed Data**: Perform statistical analyses (e.g., regression) on the transformed data.\n",
    "### Practical Considerations:\n",
    "- The Box-Cox transformation is only applicable to positive data. If the dataset contains zero or negative values, it needs to be shifted by adding a constant to make all values positive before applying the transformation.\n",
    "- Interpretation of results may change after transformation, and it may be necessary to transform results back to the original scale for reporting purposes.\n",
    "Overall, the Box-Cox transformation is a powerful tool in the preprocessing step of statistical analysis to meet the assumptions required for various parametric tests and models."
